   <h1> Measuring DC Motor Parameters -  Motor JGA25-370</h1>
   <div class="content1">
       <h3> Motivation </h3>
       <ul> 
          <li> There are a lot of applications using the motor JGA25-370 controlled by Arduino Platform.</li>
		  <li> For tuning the control compensator, the plant transfer function is needed, but there is not enough data in motor datasheet to determine it.</li>
          <li> We can find a lot of parameter estimation and identification algoritms in the literature, which implies a complex implementation and requires a sofisticated lab structure.</li>
          <li> In this context, this page presents a simple proposal to get the DC motor parameters using a simple lab structure: </li>
		  <ul>
		     <li>PC computer </li>
		     <li>Arduino UNO </li>
			 <li>DC Motor JGA25-370 with gear box and encoder (Note: a second unit was used in one of the tests.) </li>
			 <li>L298N Motor Driver Module  </li>
			 <li>4x4 Keypad connected to HW-400 PCF8574 I2C Serial IO expansion board (Library available in github) </li>
			 <li>LCD with I2C Serial Interface Module (Library available in github).</li>
			 <li>Jumpers for connections </li>		 
			 <li>Hikari HX-120 LCR Meter </li>
			 <li>Hikari HM-2090 Digital Multimeter</li>
			 <li>DC Power Suppliers: 5V (LCD, keypad and interface modules - to not overload voltage regulator in Arduino board), 12V (L298N bridge), USB or 9V* power source (to supply Arduino Board).<br>
			       <small>* Recommend if some analog input will be used, since it provides a more stable voltage reference to ADC. </small></li>
		  </ul>
		  <li>It is important to emphasize that the intention is to keep the method simple, then, a simple parameter estimation will be obtained to support the motor control strategies. For better results, the reader has to look for more precise identification algorithms and better lab resources.</li>
          <li> Several dynamic aspects of the system were neglected in order to obtain only the parameters of the second-order dynamic model of a DC machine. </li>

           <li>Unfortunately the data necessary to write the dynamic equations of JGA25-370 are not available in datasheet (Table I), so you can use the procedure presented below to get them.</li>
           <li>JGA25-370 is a small motor implying a low time constant. If the mechanical load related to the application has low inertia too, this can lead a very fast system, implying the necessity of a high sample rate to measure and control the system, as well as a powerfull microcontroller. As the idea here is to use a simple microcontroller, the system inertia moment was increased by coupling a rotating mass, as seen in Fig. 2</li>

        <h3> Dynamic Model of a DC Motor </h3>
		<ul>
           <li>In the present proposal, it will be considering the simple model of a DC motor. Dynamic aspects of the gearbox will be neglected. </li>
           <li>The scheme of the DC motor is shown in Fig.3. </li>
		   <li>The loop equation of the electrical circuit of the armature (1) and the mechanical equation (2) of the motor are presented below, where:</li>

		       <li><i>R</i> is the armature resistance; </li>
			   <li><i>L</i> is the armature inductance; </li>
			   <li><i>J</i> is the inertia moment; </li>

			   <li><i>e</i> is the back electromotive force; </li>
			   <li><i>V<sub>a</sub></i> is the armature voltage; </li>	
			   <li><i>T<sub>m</sub></i> is the motor torque; </li>	
			   <li><i>T<sub>L</sub></i> is the load torque. </li>

		   $$ L\frac{di_a}{dt}\ +\ R\ i_a\ \ =\ V_a\ -e     \ \      (1)$$
		   $$ J\frac{d\omega}{dt}\ +\ B\ \omega\ \ =\ T_m\ -T_L \ \  (2)$$
           <li>JGA25-370 doesn't have field winding and the magnetic field is produced by permanent magnets, then, for a constant magnetic field, the motor torque is proportional to the armature current, and the electromotive force is proportional to the speed, as determined by (3) and (4), respectively, where:</li>			   		   
		   <ul>
			   <li>kT is the torque constant; </li>

		<li>According to (4), the Table II data should represent a linear function crossing the origin, but considering the linear regression of these points, we can see some deviation.

		</ul>	
		$$ k_e = 0.577 V/(rad/s) \ \ (9) $$
		<ul>
		   <li>In order to determine the torque constant, the L298N bridge was connected to a 12V power supply, and the motor was driven with the maximum duty cycle, resulting in <i>V<sub>a</sub></i>=10.6V, due to the saturation voltage over the bridge transistors, <i>I<sub>a</sub></i>=106mA and <i>&#969</i>=2.78 rps (17.467 rad/s), which implies <i>P</i>=1.1236 W delivered to the motor.</li>
		   <li>Subtracting the armature losses from the power delivered to the motor, we have:</li>
		</ul>
		$$ P_m = P - R\ i_a^2 = 1.0676 W \ \ (10) $$

          <li>The system in Fig. 2 will be modeled according to the scheme presented in Fig. 4. The dynamic effect of the gearbox will be neglected, and it will be considered a unique inertia moment <i>J</i>, a friction coefficient <i>B</i>, and constant load torque <i>T<sub>L</sub></i> in the opposite direction of the rotation. </li>
		  <li>The load torque (12) presents a non-linearity at the origin, as can be seen in Fig. 5. But in the following analysis, the torque can be assumed to be piecewise linear.</li>

		    <li> Considering Table III data and (15), <i>B</i> can be determined (16), as well <i>T<sub>L</sub></i> (17): </li>

		 $$ T_L= 0.03593 N.m \ \ (17) $$
		<ul>
		   <li>In order to determine the inertia moment <i>J</i>, it was considered the system deceleration curve, which is presented in Fig. 6. That is, the motor was accelerated, then when the speed achieved the steady state, the armature circuit was open. After that we have the motor deceleration until the speed reaches zero.</li>
		   <li>As can be seen in Fig. 6, the derivative of speed presents a discontinuity when the speed reaches zero. This is due to the non-linearity of load torque shown in Fig. 5. To calculate <i>J</i> only the part corresponding to the linear response of the deceleration curve will be considered. </li>
		   <li>Each blue circle in Fig.6 represents a speed sample. The initial speed is 2.58 rps. This implies 2.58*45=116.1 rps in the internal motor axis. In order to measure the speed the signals A and B of the encoder were connected to the pins INT0 and INT1 (external interrupts) of the Arduino UNO. These pins were programmed to request external interrupts at any logical change. So, this will implies 4 interrupt requests to each encoder pulse, or 44 interrupt requests per revolution. As a result, the interrupt counter incremented by both INT0 and INT1 ISR advances 5108 positions every second for a speed of 2.58 rps.</li>
	       <li>The problem is that in a speed control loop for a fast system, it is not possible to wait one second to get the speed sample. This will implies a cost-benefit relation, since the high is the sample rate, the low is the resolution of the speed measurement. Considering a 100 Hz sample rate, the counter advances around 51 positions per period for a speed of 2.58 rps. This was the sample rate considered in the test presented in Fig.6, so we have one sample at each 0.01 s. The Arduino code used to get the results shown in Fig. 6 is presented below.</li>

		 <li> Neglecting the load torque non-linearity and considering a constant torque <i>T<sub>L</sub></i> (like in a hoist application) and the armature circuit open, that is, <i>T<sub>m</sub>=0</i>,  the system can be described by (17). </li>
         <li> Equation (17) is linear non-homogeneous first order equation. We can use Laplace Transform to solve it. Thus, considering (18), we can determine the Laplace Transform of (17), as can be seen in (19). </li>

		   <li>Then, determining the inverse Laplace Transform of (21), we have <i>&#969 (t), as seen in (22).</i> </li>

		   <li>In order to determine <i>J</i>, we can use an exponential regression tool. Note that <i>B</i> and <i>T<sub>L</sub></i> were determined previously by (16) and (17), respectively. </li>
		   <li>As the exponential regression tools normally are related to basic functions, like that one presented in (23), we can apply a displacement in Y-axis of (22), as shown in (24), in order to fit in (23). </li>

		<ul> 
		   <li>Based on the method presented in this page to get the parameters of JGA25-370 Motor, try to modify the Arduino C code below to provide the speed closed-loop control of the motor</li>
	       <li>Note that the plant transfer function is decribed by (8). </li>
		   <li>In case to acquire electric quantities of the motor, see a way to use the ADC in the link below. </li>
